#VISAGO

VISAGO is a web application to improve the relationship between the student and the teacher and to improve the student’s self-motivation. This web application will provide the teacher to see all student’s engagement level and the teacher will be able to know the attendance of each and every student from the post report. For future work developers could add facial recognition when it comes to marking attendance and this method will improve the accuracy of the system.
